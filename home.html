    On the first week of September we received an email for an interview. It was on the 3rd of 
    September. We start the day with introduction and collaborative assignments. The 
    collaborative assignment was about the concept of freedom by _____ (ask to Wendy). We were
    divided into small groups and doing a peer to peer learning and created a project together. 
    After that we were asked to present our collaborative works. The next agenda was the 
    interview. The interview was done individually. We were invited to a separate room and asked
    a general question. The language used for the course is English.<br><br><hr>
    The selected participants start the course on the 9th September. Only 15 people are chosen. 
    The course will be held for about 3 months (until November). The first day of the course was
    fun and insightful. It was introducing about the open design concept as a whole. 
    We learned also about soft tools and digital tools during the course. We discussed
    also about copy right, peer to peer learning methods, etc. 
    Our course is a unique kind of learning environment. The teachers were coming
    from many different backgrounds. The learning environment was more of a 
    sharing knowledge and ideas. Some of the subject we learned in the course 
    ie Sound, HTML, Arduino, Blender, Narative Practices, The Screen Printing, 
    The Book Cover experiment, Libre object workshop. The course was design to 
    facilitate different kind of interest from the participants. It was very inspiring
    to meet with people who have different interest. The organizer also provided the 
    participants with transportation reimbursement and lunch. Besides that they also borrowed
    us a laptop for us to work. We had opportunities to follow workshops and or projects outside
    the regular course in the weekend. For example the School of Love, Visible Project, and 
    Sophia Conference.<br><br><hr>
    At the end of the course, each participant can chose any kind of projects suited with 
    his/her interest. The organizer gave certain amount of fund to support the projects. 
    This project will be shown on an exhibition on the last week of November. A certificate 
    of attendance of the course will be given at the end of the course.
